This project is a slightly modified copy of the backend service of the actively used CostAnalysis project that I developed during my internship at LC Waikiki. 
It is designed to validate Excel files created for the Finance departmentâ€™s Excel-based reporting processes and to save the data into the database after performing certain checks.
